I’m excited to share that my second PhD paper [(CyberLLMInstruct: A Pseudo-Malicious Dataset Revealing Safety-Performance Trade-offs in Cyber Security LLM Fine-tuning)](/assets/pdf/CyberLLMInstruct.pdf) has been accepted to the [AISec Workshop](https://aisec.cc/), co-located with [32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/). I’ll be presenting it in Taipei, Taiwan on October 17th, 2025.
