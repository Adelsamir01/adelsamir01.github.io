Thrilled to be in Copenhagen, Denmark, presenting our latest research at the International Workshop on Emerging Technology in IoT, part of the IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings-2024)! üåç‚ú®

Our paper, "Privacy Threats and Countermeasures in Federated Learning for Internet of Things: A Systematic Review," co-authored with my PhD supervisor Dr. Budi Arief, dives deep into the evolving landscape of privacy in federated learning for IoT systems. It was an honor to share our work with the research community.
