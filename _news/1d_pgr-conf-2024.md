Presented my research work on federated learning framework for IoT security at the University of Kent's Annual Postgraduate Conference 2024. The conference, organized by the Graduate and Researcher College (GRC) in collaboration with various university divisions, provided an excellent platform to showcase our ongoing research through both a presentation and a poster.

The event brought together postgraduate researchers from across the university, featuring research talks, interactive workshops, and a poster exhibition. It was a valuable opportunity to receive feedback from peers and academics from different disciplines, while also networking during the awards ceremony and buffet lunch.
