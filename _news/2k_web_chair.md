I am pleased to announce that I will be serving as the **Web Chair** for **[AI-SS 2026](https://cyber.kent.ac.uk/events/AI-SS2026/)**, the **1st International Workshop on AI Safety and Security**.

The workshop will be held on **7 April 2026** at the [University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk/), Canterbury, UK, and is co-located with **[EDCC 2026](https://edcc.dependability.org/) (21st European Dependable Computing Conference)**.

The workshop aims to bridge the dependability and AI research communities by addressing fundamental and practical challenges in AI safety, security, and trustworthiness. Accepted papers will be included in the companion proceedings of **EDCC 2026**.
