I am excited to share that I participated in the prestigious [3 Minute Thesis (3MT) competition](https://student.kent.ac.uk/life/postgrad/3mt) at the University of Kent! The 3MT challenges doctoral researchers to present their research and its significance in just three minutes, using only one slide.

I am thrilled to announce that I have been **shortlisted for the final round**, which will take place on **27th May 2025**. Wish me luck in the final! :D

Below is the slide I used in my presentation:
