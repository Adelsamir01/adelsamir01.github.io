I am excited to share that I participated in the prestigious [3 Minute Thesis (3MT) competition](https://student.kent.ac.uk/life/postgrad/3mt) at the University of Kent! The 3MT challenges doctoral researchers to present their research and its significance in just three minutes, using only one slide.

I am thrilled to announce that I have been **shortlisted for the final round**, which took place on **27th May 2025**. The competition was incredibly close and competitive, with all finalists delivering outstanding presentations. I believe I performed exceptionally well, meeting all the judging criteria for the 3MT competition. However, as with any competition, judging can sometimes be subjective. الحمد لله على كل حال.

Below is the slide I used in my presentation:

Thank you to everyone who supported me throughout this journey. It was an incredible experience that helped me grow as a researcher and presenter!
