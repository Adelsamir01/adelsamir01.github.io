On Thursday 27th November, I had the privilege of leading the simulated mini-competition at the [NCSC CyberFirst Girls Competition Familiarisation Day](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberfirst/girls-competition), organised by the [Institute of Cyber Security for Society (iCSS)](https://research.kent.ac.uk/cyber/) at [The Folkestone School for Girls](https://www.folkestonegirls.kent.sch.uk/).

The event saw 48 Year 8 students (ages 12-13) participate in various activities designed to inspire them to consider careers in cyber security and computer science.

### Leading the Challenge

My role as the workshop lead involved guiding the students through a simulated competition. It was an opportunity to support local schools and encourage girls to participate in the NCSC’s upcoming [CyberFirst Girls Competition](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberfirst/girls-competition).

> "As the workshop lead for the CyberFirst girls familiarisation day, I was genuinely impressed by how motivated and excited the participants were throughout the session. Most of the teams successfully completed the challenges, demonstrating great enthusiasm and determination. When given clear instructions and a clean system to test their problem-solving skills, the girls truly flourished, showing confidence, creativity and a strong willingness to learn."

### A Collaborative Effort

The event was a significant collaborative effort, supported by the [KMCS3 (Kent & Medway Cyber Security Student Society)](https://research.kent.ac.uk/cyber/), cyber security researchers, and industry professionals. It also featured a deepfake detection mini-competition led by Professor Shujun Li and career insights from female leaders in the field.

It was rewarding to verify the impact of these events in building confidence and interest in cyber security among young students.
