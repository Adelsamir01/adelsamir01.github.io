Proud to represent the School of Computing at the University of Kent's Winter Showcase 2024, where I presented my ongoing research on designing a federated learning framework for IoT security. I was the only researcher presenting from the School of Computing that day, making it a special opportunity to highlight our work to the broader university community.

The Winter Showcase provided an excellent platform for connecting with peers across different disciplines, sharing research insights, and receiving valuable feedback. The event brought together postgraduate researchers from various fields, fostering interdisciplinary discussions and networking opportunities.
