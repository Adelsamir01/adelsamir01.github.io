On **5th February 2026**, I had the privilege of delivering a technical talk on **AI in Cyber Security** to the Development and AI team at [Centenary Bank](https://www.centenarybank.co.ug/), Uganda.

I was invited by [Rodney Adriko](https://research.kent.ac.uk/cyber/person/rodney-adriko/), a fellow researcher at the [Institute of Cyber Security for Society (iCSS)](https://research.kent.ac.uk/cyber/), to share insights on the intersection of artificial intelligence and cyber security.

The session brought together **more than 30 professionals** for an engaging **1.5-hour discussion** covering various aspects of AI in cyber security, including:

- AI-driven threat detection and response
- Security challenges in AI systems
- Practical applications of AI in banking security
- Emerging trends and future directions

It was a rewarding experience to engage with industry professionals and discuss how AI is transforming the cyber security landscape in the financial sector.
