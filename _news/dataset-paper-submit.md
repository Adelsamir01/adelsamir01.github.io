Submitted my second paper during my PhD as a resource paper to the prestigious [48th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2025)](https://sigir2025.dei.unipd.it/). The paper titled "CyberLLMInstruct: A New Dataset for Analysing Safety of Fine-Tuned LLMs Using Cyber Security Data" presents our work on developing and analysing a specialised dataset for evaluating AI safety in the context of cyber security.
