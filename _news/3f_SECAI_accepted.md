Iâ€™m excited to share that my third PhD paper [(Analysing Safety Risks in LLMs Fine-Tuned with Pseudo-Malicious Cyber Security Data)](/assets/pdf/analysing_llm_risks_paper.pdf) has been accepted to the [SECAI 2025 Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/secai2025/), in conjunction with [30th European Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS) 2025](https://esorics2025.sciencesconf.org/).
