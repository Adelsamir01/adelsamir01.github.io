I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed the [Cyber Runway Launch](https://www.plexal.com/cyber-runway-launch/) program! This journey, funded by the [Department for Science, Innovation and Technology](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-science-innovation-and-technology) and delivered by [Plexal](https://www.plexal.com/), has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my professional development.

The program started with a virtual session on July 9, 2024, where I first met my cohort - the amazing group you see in the photo above! (Can you spot me? Hint: I'm the one who looks most excited about cyber security! ðŸ˜„) We were a diverse group of passionate individuals from different backgrounds, all united by our interest in cyber security entrepreneurship. The highlight was the intensive three-day in-person bootcamp from July 16-18 at Plexal's London offices. These days were transformative, filled with engaging workshops, hands-on activities, and many opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals who shared my passion for cyber security innovation.

What made this experience special were the connections I made. I had the opportunity to meet and learn from:
- Fellow entrepreneurs with great ideas in the cyber security space
- Industry experts who shared their knowledge and experiences
- Mentors who provided valuable guidance and support
- Program organizers who created an environment that encouraged collaboration and growth

The program continued with a virtual session on July 26 and two reunion events:
- A festive gathering on December 5, 2024, which included the Plexal Christmas Party - a great chance to reconnect with my cohort and celebrate our progress
- A Cardiff meetup on January 15, 2025, at [sbarc\|spark](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/campus-developments/projects/spark) - I wasn't able to attend this one, but it gave my cohort another chance to reconnect and experience the bootcamp atmosphere in a new setting

Throughout the program, I learned about:
- Understanding the cyber security landscape and trends
- Developing value propositions and business strategies
- Building sales strategies for startups
- Validating customer groups and market positioning
- Exploring funding options
- Focusing on resilience and mental health
- Incorporating diversity and inclusion in business practices

Beyond the technical knowledge, what I value most are the relationships I've built. The program created a supportive community of cyber security enthusiasts and entrepreneurs, and I'm happy to now be part of this network. These connections have enriched my professional journey and opened doors to new opportunities and collaborations.

The program ended with a graduation ceremony on February 27, 2025, where we celebrated our achievements together. This experience has been transformative, giving me not just the tools and knowledge, but also a strong network of peers and mentors to support my future work in the cyber security space.

One of the most valuable aspects of this program was how it helped me evolve my product idea. I entered with a specific cyber security product concept, but through discussions with mentors and the sessions on customer profiling, I realized the importance of focusing on building the right solution for the right audience. This led me to pivot my approach and refine my thinking about the product. This shift in perspective has been incredibly valuable for my entrepreneurial journey!

And here's my certificate of completion:
