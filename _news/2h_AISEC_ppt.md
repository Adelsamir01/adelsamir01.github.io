I'm excited to share that I presented my paper [(CyberLLMInstruct: A Pseudo-Malicious Dataset Revealing Safety-Performance Trade-offs in Cyber Security LLM Fine-tuning)](/assets/pdf/CyberLLMInstruct.pdf) at the [AISec Workshop](https://aisec.cc/), co-located with [32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/) in Taipei, Taiwan on October 17th, 2025.

The presentation was an incredible experience, filled with inspiring conversations, brilliant minds, and thought-provoking discussions on the rapidly evolving fields of AI security and AI safety. It was amazing to connect with researchers and practitioners from around the world who generously took the time to share their insights and ideas.

A huge thank you to everyone I met this week â€” your passion and expertise made this experience unforgettable. Feeling recharged and excited for what's next! ðŸš€
