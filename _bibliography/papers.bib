To add publications create a new entry in the [\_bibliography/papers.bib](_bibliography/papers.bib) file. 
You can find the BibTeX entry of a publication in Google Scholar by clicking on the quotation marks below the publication title, 
then clicking on "BibTeX", or also in the conference page itself. By default, the publications will be sorted by year and the most 
recent will be displayed first. You can change this behavior and more in the `Jekyll Scholar` section in [\_config.yml](_config.yml) file.

You can add extra information to a publication, like a PDF file in the `assets/pdfs/` directory and add the path to the PDF file in 
the BibTeX entry with the `pdf` field. Some of the supported fields are: 

`abstract`, `altmetric`, `arxiv`, `bibtex_show`, `blog`, `code`, `dimensions`, `doi`, `eprint`, `html`, `isbn`, 

`pdf`, `pmid`, `poster`, `slides`, `supp`, `video`, and `website`.
